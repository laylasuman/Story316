Rammstein went to the Berlin Flughafen to fly to their upcoming concert.
One of the band's memebers tore his lederhose when landing.
The worst part was that it happened right on the hauptstrasse while they were out eating bratwurst and brot.
They eventually had to replace it with a Dirndel that they borrowed from the Eltz's schloss.
At the schloss they found a Hund.
The Hund suddenly talked, "Hey, the name's Porsche. Whacha doin'?"
"Heading back from the baeckerei on Hauptstrasse- wait who said that?"
"Down here," came the voice of the hund, crumbs of partially eaten gebaeck stuck to its muzzle.
He was over by the controls to the Klimaanlage, since there was no Schloss on the cover.
